# Vulnerability-Test
This program utilizes Nmap to scan an address/network and provide a detailed output of open/closed ports, device name, and connection status. This program aims to create an accurate log and detailed access mechanism in case of intrusions. It allows the programmer to trace the specifications of an exploit and keep track of IP addresses when relevant. It uses data types such as dictionaries/hashmaps and lists to store network data and check against future attacks. This vulnerability test leverages existing information to compile and check for flawed/relevant addresses. 

To run this program, you have to create a virtual environment. 
- Navigate into the environment <source venv/bin/activate>
- run using <sudo vuln-tester.py>
- It will be your device's password if it requires a password. I have no access to those details.
- Ensure you have nmap installed. (pip install python-nmap)
- To run use <sudo python vuln-tester.py>
