# Vulnerability-Test
This program utilizes Nmap to scan an address/network and provide a detailed output of open/closed ports, device name and connection status. The aim of this program is to create an accurate log and detailed access mechanism in case of intrusions. It allows the programmer run a trace the specifications of an exploit and keep track of IP addresses when relevant. It uses data types such as dictionaries/hashmap and lists to store network data and check against future attacks. This Vulnerability test leverages existing information in compiling and checking for flawed/relevant addresses.
